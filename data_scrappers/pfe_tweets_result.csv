1243931159060414464,2020-03-28 16:01:14+00:00,been on the phone with gamestop for 4 hours and they dropped my call so now i have to call again just to change my shipping address i stg never use gamestop to buy anything just go to best buy its much better
1243930480472477696,2020-03-28 15:58:32+00:00,I‚Äôm tired of people bitching about SBMM. What if you‚Äôre not as good as you think? What if people learn to play the game? Stop bitching cause you aren‚Äôt getting bots. Learn to play against harder opponents sometimes you run into someone who‚Äôs just better. Hard pill to swallow.
1243928057460686848,2020-03-28 15:48:54+00:00,Seriously @GameStop? You're making your employees put a plastic bag over their hands? You're business is not that important and I won't be shopping there anymore.
1243927528747798528,2020-03-28 15:46:48+00:00,The Gamestop near my house has animal crossing in stock. This could be it...
1243925733107523585,2020-03-28 15:39:40+00:00,when i was a kid i returned shadow the hedgehog to gamestop because he had a gun and used bad words

1243921456842641413,2020-03-28 15:22:40+00:00,Gamestop telling their employees to wrap their hands with a plastic bag to protect against covid is so cartoonishly evil it makes me wonder if Dr. Evil is running the corporation behind the scenes
1243921342778339329,2020-03-28 15:22:13+00:00,"Are there any

1243915055789473797,2020-03-28 14:57:14+00:00,So y‚Äôall really bullied gamestop to believe they aren‚Äôt essential ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£fuck

1243914030202445824,2020-03-28 14:53:10+00:00,Is game stop essential?
1243913373588340741,2020-03-28 14:50:33+00:00,What‚Äôs Amazon‚Äôs game shipping time these days? I wanna get resident evil 3 and cancel my preorder at GameStop later lol they have release day shipping but I know things are a lil delayed. Those who preordered animal crossing by Amazon how long did it take? #ACNH
1243913021954633730,2020-03-28 14:49:09+00:00,Is GameStop open or doing pickups
1243912923526959104,2020-03-28 14:48:46+00:00,GameStop considers themselves an ‚Äúessential business‚Äù and is trying to push to stay open during the pandemic in states that shut down all but essential businesses. They‚Äôve reached a new level of desperation. Time for them to just go away
1243912853062631429,2020-03-28 14:48:29+00:00,GameStop not even open so i can‚Äôt trade in games for resident evil 3 ü•∫
1243912037585096710,2020-03-28 14:45:15+00:00,GameStop is closed :/
1243905309468434432,2020-03-28 14:18:31+00:00,Had another dream about GameStop
1243903797954596865,2020-03-28 14:12:30+00:00,Yoo Gamestop got me fucked upü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1243901451497279489,2020-03-28 14:03:11+00:00,I am preparing a lengthy video about GameStop and its business practices. Especially on how poorly they handled the safety of their staff and customers during the Corona outbreak and how they are still trying to keep their business open despite most stores being closed.
1243901214540140544,2020-03-28 14:02:14+00:00,how is gamestop not essential ??????!!
1243900892686024704,2020-03-28 14:00:58+00:00,Who here has pre-ordered something and will NOT be able to pick it up?  Called gamestop corporate and they will NOT be changing in store pre-orders over to mail orders.  Who else is stuck waiting until stores open back up before they get a game they paid for already?  FFVII :(
1243899453750337537,2020-03-28 13:55:14+00:00,"But hey, @GameStop , if you want to trade in my $60 rant, the best I can do for you is $6."
1243899293544656897,2020-03-28 13:54:36+00:00,So I just went ahead and pre ordered from Best Buy ! Because unlike GameStop you can still pre order something online and go pick it up at the door. GameStop if you didn‚Äôt pre order something in store you aren‚Äôt allowed to pick it up but only have it delivered with the stupid-
1243899196337524737,2020-03-28 13:54:13+00:00,"So when the riots start, we're specifically targeting Game Stop and Hobby Lobby for looting first, right? Dibs on the copic markers."
1243898637433872387,2020-03-28 13:52:00+00:00,But the fact that @GameStop has kept their store open during these times and not properly equipped their stores to effectively clean and operate their stores to the best ability just goes to show that @GameStop doesn't care about their own employees or the consumer.
1243898173799772161,2020-03-28 13:50:09+00:00,"However, with a poor business model that hasn't evolved over time, @GameStop needs to die. Over the years the company has scrambled to try to keep their head above water so they don't inevitably sink (which they should)."
1243897607744827394,2020-03-28 13:47:54+00:00,So I'm a little concerned. I ordered a Switch yesterday from @GameStop and they do this pickup the door thing. I've tried calling my store and get no answer or anything. I've gotten no follow up email and wait times for the GameStop number is over 60 minutes ugh
1243895520441053184,2020-03-28 13:39:37+00:00,"It's sad to say that the last game I'll ever buy from @GameStop will be Animal Crossing. Being a former employee, it was nice having a store that was just for gamers where we could buy video games, video game merch, and connect with people."
1243895114805792770,2020-03-28 13:38:00+00:00,"To clarify a previous tweet:
