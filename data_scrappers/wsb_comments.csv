"**If GME 230 EOD will share a pic of my wife's tits with WSB written on them (She had a boobjob).**

**You can screenshot this!**","Revolut saying AMC shares are $8 and GME $166 but when try buy they are up and $10 and $195 
Anyone any insight?","It's ""only"" 20 million shares converted from from class D to class A shares from Rock Holdings. Dan and Jennifer are insiders at RKT Companies and Rock Holdings so they each have to seperately file a form 4, hence the forms in triplicate.

This is how they are funding their 500 mil investment in Detroit.

The big question is, who is the whale that bought 20 mil shares above market price? Buffet? Kathy? Elon? Some boring ass institutional vendor? who knows? It will be spicy if we find out though.","25k buyin @ $3.5 dumped at $23

I think BB is viable long-term and getting hit with the tech selloff that's still occurring 

Have a standing buy at $7.10 for the same quantity as above

Picked it up in the tech fall mid june last year, hoping it holds up til June so I can pay less tax on it.

No idea why this popped up in my feed, but recommend BB as a mid-term hold but not at current price, they're still dropping.

I reckon they're valued between $7 and $16 based on assets, market reach and existing long-term contracts.",GO PLTR,"Weed Gang baby ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Roll call post them big fat green dildo tickers
