This brings the public float to 115m + 60m = 175m shares, and decreases Dan et al's stake to roughly 1.85B shares. This means that another small sale or some restricted stock vesting will bring the public float to 10% of the company. RKT has had already 3 profitable trailing quarters since trading publicly. So after the next earnings (late may), RKT will likely meet all the requirements for S&amp;P500 inclusion. Remember RKT is the biggest  non-bank lender and has over $40B market cap, it's almost certain that they will be included at some point.Another interesting thing about the sale - the 60m shares, worth \~$1.5B, was snatched up really fast for $25.25-$26.25 per share. This suggests that there were a small number of buyers. As the 13F filings come in, we will find out who bought a stake in RKT.

If there are a chain of strike prices w/ high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain (in this case, $25 was the first link, while at the time of writing it is now $28.34), it can cause a reaction where MM need to delta hedge these options by buying shares (as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums), which increase the stock's price, which lets us hit the next link in the chain, etc. etc.Forbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to GME: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/).As we can see, open interest is also high on options (ex: 19000 calls on 3/16 for $30). https://preview.redd.it/2ph9enq8hlq61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7105dc532cce8fc36164931e890c51656b9c65If the stock can near/hit $30, it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by MMs. This will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43%, all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price (\~$23), shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards.**Reopening play**Dicks Sporting Goods no longer sells guns in Texas. As people go out more / reignite their hobbies, ASO will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns. Even as a long term hold (instead of playing the options chain) this seems like a good play.**The play**I think there's potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 4/16. The open interest is there, the catalyst is there (run up in stock price due to amazing earnings), and there's the additional high short interest which means if things moon, they'll moon even harder. The options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well.**The bear case**The earnings report isn't enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 4/16. Another catalyst doesn't come, or the market in general corrects (as we are at ATH). In this case, the call option ladder will fail to materialize.**Positions:**200 4/16C w/ $30 strike price.",Currently WAY undervalued!

I wrote the first half of this DD a few months ago and decided to wait until next earnings for more updated information. The most recent earnings was a green light for me.**FUNDAMENTALS:**[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNDM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNDM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNDM/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNDM/)Looking at these, Nano Dimension (NNDM) has a few pretty bad ratios and statistics. However the position that the company is currently in seems to have incredible value if they can be successful with the Dragonfly. Buckle up cause this is my first full-fledged DD. Would love hearing counter arguments or opinions.**COMPETITION:**\- Stratasys (SSYS)\- 3D Systems Corp. (DDD)\- Proto Labs Inc (PRLB)\- The ExOne Co. (XONE)Except guess what? None of these companies are actual competitors because they can‚Äôt 3D print electronics. There's more competitors [on this page](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NNDM/competitors-and-alternatives/) I'm still researching, but none of them seem to offer additive manufacturing for ELECTRONICS like NNDM does, so none of them are actual competitors. Subsequently, Direct Competitors in Additively Manufactured Electronics:Primary Competition:\- Botfactory (Private)Others:\- NovaCentrix (Private)\- nScrypt (Private)\- IDTechEx (Private)\- Electroninks (Private)**COMPANY OVERVIEW:**Good Slideshow summary here:[https://s23.q4cdn.com/747906804/files/doc\_presentations/2021/2021-1-25-NNDM\_Corporate\_Presentation.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/747906804/files/doc_presentations/2021/2021-1-25-NNDM_Corporate_Presentation.pdf)*""Nano Dimension ($NNDM) is a provider of intelligent machines for the fabrication of Additively Manufactured Electronics. Nano Dimension bridges the gap between printed circuit boards, and semiconductor integrated circuits.""**""In late 2015, the company unveiled the Dragonfly, which it claims is the first desktop 3D printer designed to produce multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs). Nano added that this innovation was, ‚Äúnew to the printed electronics design and manufacturing industry. They claimed that older methods had too many phases, were labor-intensive and wasted a lot of time and materials. This forced companies to outsource prototypes rather than produce them in-house during the development phase. PCBs are boards that hold silicon chips (i.e. semiconductors) and enable them to be connected. Further, they are now used in virtually all but the most primitive commercially produced electronics.""***PRODUCT OFFERINGS:** (as of 3/11/21)Dragonfly:\- Generation 1: Dragonfly 3D Printer (2015)\- Generation 2: Dragonfly Pro (2018)\- Generation 3: Dragonfly LDM (July 2019)\- Generation 4: (2021/ early 2022)NaNos 3D Fabrication Service (New)With the current generation, the Dragonfly LDM, companies can *""reduce demand on prototyping and short-run manufacturing resources which lowers the cost of operation in comparison to traditional methods. The Dragonfly LDM is patented and has new proprietary technology that enables 24/7 uninterrupted 3D printing, the industries only comprehensive platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.""*Keeping the entire development process securely in house is more important now than ever, as China has continually been accused of intellectual property theft, with a staggering 1 in 5 companies saying China has stolen their intellectual property within the last year. According to the United States Trade Representative Report (2017), Chinese theft of American IP costs American companies between $225 billion - $660 billion annually. Which exemplifies the growing importance for US companies to keep their intellectual property and development process in house and secure.*""Electronic circuitry is traditionally developed through a back and forth process involving lots of trial &amp; error and third-party manufacturer outsourcing. The industry‚Äôs largest hurdle has been being unable to offer a solution for the electronics market, primarily because of the difficulty in printing multiple layers of electrically conductive, dielectric materials at a resolution high enough to support professional electronics.""* That is until Nano Dimension was the first to develop an integrated solution for additive manufacturing of electronics, hence why I couldn‚Äôt find any competitors. What Nano Dimension's doing with the Dragonfly is disruptive to the PCB industry.**ADDRESSING THE MANY DIRECT OFFERINGS:**Although the company has used many direct offerings to raise money, \[then\] CEO Yaov Stern stated that they now have $990 Million of cash reserves (2/2/2021). This will allow NNDM to recover quickly from the halt in sales and is a primer for the huge growth stage that they are going to experience in the coming year and beyond. NNDM is also using the cash reserves for a huge acceleration in R&amp;D, and also for acquisitions of new technologies that they plan on incorporating into new Dragonfly models. Stern says they are looking at 3 or 4 Israeli companies, 3 or 4 European countries, and 4 or 5 US companies (3/11/21). He also mentions that the drastic increase of SPACs in the United States causes many companies to be overvalued. Which as far as I can tell, means he wants to acquire the companies before they go public (in the US at least). In regard to those SPACs:*‚ÄúI‚Äôm very careful of being pulled into this rat race of paying too much. It‚Äôs a rat race. Even if you win you‚Äôre still a rat.‚Äù*One goal with NNDM‚Äôs heavy investment in R&amp;D is to improve machine consistency and support ink types other than silver, which can be expensive. They have been gaining progress on this front but I would still consider it one of their current challenges.**REVENUE AND SALES:**Determining an actual target price seems to be impossible due to negative EPS. However NNDM is in an early stage of commercial production with a razor &amp; blade model, so this is acceptable for now. The growth during this stage has also stagnated due to COVID-19, and despite 2020 revenue being half that of 2019, it‚Äôs still quite surprising because of the incredibly low sales volume from 2020 during the pandemic. Which means customers are indeed using consumables for the Dragonfly, and the razor/razorblade business model is proving to be quite effective.Stern also notes that as of 3/11, 70% of their customers have upgraded to the newest generation of the Dragonfly (compared to the prior version that came out in 2018). Stern is also confident that with all the new applications coming in that are military and industrial spec, once the materials are available post Covid, revenue will skyrocket. All of this along with the business model proving to be at the very least acceptable, if not incredibly effective, seems promising.(3/11/21) 4 levels of revenue:1. Dragonfly Sales2. Consumables (Only NNDM can offer the ink, hence Razor &amp; Blade model)3. Selling maintenance contracts annually (After 1-year warranty)4. The newly implemented NaNos (Nano Services), which according to Stern is quickly growing**NEW PRODUCTS:**As mentioned, NNDM is now offering Nano Services (NaNos). Those who don‚Äôt buy the machine because they are waiting for the budget to be released can use the software to prototype their products, and NNDM will print it for them using in house machines, to which those companies will only pay per round of prototyping rather than paying for a whole machine which they currently cannot afford. These customers stay in contact with NNDM and by the time we‚Äôre out of Covid and those customers have a more flexible budget, they will already be familiar with the software and it will have a slingshot effect on future sales.NNDM is also planning to release the new generation of the dragonfly in mid-2021, which is currently in the middle of alpha stage development. They‚Äôre hoping to release it mid 2021 or once the pandemic is officially over.*‚ÄúThe machines we have now are for prototyping and proof of concept. The new system is going to be getting into early stages of production. Even existing machines are currently being used in the production stage by some customers, specifically in defense.‚Äù* The new machines provide a heighted Z-axis, which allows for multilayered *circuit cubes* rather than one giant sheet of circuits.*""This is the only technology in the world that can take a digital file and 3D-print a high-performance electronic part.""* That is, a 3D printed circuit board with upwards of 20 or 30 layers. (Each layer being a micro and a half). Normal circuit boards can become incredibly expensive the more layers they have. Whereas a 3D printer doesn‚Äôt charge you extra for multiple layers because it doesn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre printing 2 layers or 30 layers, it just needs the material.In addition: *‚ÄúOur machine, unlike the standard PCB industry that‚Äôs full of non-reusable materials, is going to be environmentally friendly‚Äù* (reusable ink cartridges).**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:***‚ÄúI also think it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that Nano could make printers that can create other computer parts given that it appears to have successfully created a 3D printer that can manufacture PCBs. Eventually, it‚Äôs possible that Nano could make 3D printers that could make semiconductors themselves.""**""In a world that‚Äôs suffering from a shortage of semiconductors, I have to believe that such a product would generate widespread demand. Given the Internet of Things trend, not to mention the recent strength of PC sales, there should be strong demand for Nano‚Äôs current printers that can already, according to the firm, make many computer parts.‚Äù*About mid-way in the call, Stern was asked if NNDM might expand its market / business model. His answer was very interesting. He said that their mainstay business was 3D printing of electrical components for the high-end market (sophisticated and very small components) - but that they also are looking a nano-scale mechanical component printing - so not just the printing of parts with electrical components, but also moving components. ( I could see this as being a profound application in insertable medical devices and in military / civilian applications that require precise moving parts in an exceptionally small space).*""He also clarified what many people here frequently misrepresent - microprocessors. NNDM can produce multilayer boards upon which many other components are stacked - such as microprocessors, capacitors, resistors, etc - so Dragonflies are very useful for designing and producing very complicated PCBs which can be the base upon which many other electronic components can be attached / stacked.""*When describing the next generation Dragonfly that's coming this summer, Stern said that the company had greatly improved the software design by making it far more user-friendly, especially for complicated component designs.*""He also said that the new printers will have the ability to add components. (I frankly did not fully understand this point, but my best guess is that it means that while a Dragonfly is printing a PCB, it would have the mechanical ability to add / insert a previously made component such as a resistor). I see that as being the first step to a ""lights out"" manufacturing process - where the human walks away from the machine and it produces not only a PCB, but also has added other subcomponents onto the board as it was printed, obviating the need for follow-on steps where a human or robot attaches components to the circuit board.‚Äù***POSSIBLE CONCERNS:****Concern 1:** *‚ÄúIn the 12 months that ended in September 2020, Nano‚Äôs top line came in at just $3.4 million. In 2019, it reported sales of $7.07 million. Those low numbers indicate that its printers have yet to achieve widespread industry acceptance.‚Äù***My opinion**: 1, The low sales from 2020 is primarily from the halt in demand due COVID according to Stern. And 2, the Dragonfly LDM was a very new product in 2019, so it didn‚Äôt really have time to gain an industry wide acceptance. In addition, these are all still very early models of what they hope to turn the Dragonfly into, as Stern explains in the 3/11 earnings interview. Just selling these early models was never the goal, and their heavy investment in R&amp;D supports this. Along with Stern's ultimate goal for the Dragonfly being production level manufacturing (Current generation is meant for prototyping and proof of concept. The next generation will start getting into first rounds of production).https://preview.redd.it/edmnsh670lq61.png?width=1624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a887703fbfdb5cb944255bbe6a46fb63936d2a**Concern 2:** *‚ÄúAlthough the company in December reported that some U.S. government agencies and European research and electronic manufacturing organizations had upgraded their Dragonfly printers, it did not identify any of these customers by name. It also did not disclose the revenue it had obtained from the deals. Those omissions make it hard to judge the extent to which the deals validate the company‚Äôs technology, let alone whether they‚Äôre a case for buying NNDM stock now.‚Äù***My opinion:** I do see how this could be a concern. However I would also understand if the government wanted to keep their contracts under the radar for ‚Äúundisclosed reasons‚Äù or something like that. I also don‚Äôt think that those contracts by themselves are a case to buy the stock. But rather the unique product they‚Äôre offering, their plan for future growth, and the value acquisition strategy accompanied with accelerated R&amp;D to maintain their current competitive advantage (Even though no other companies can directly compete with this product yet). If they start to take on a lot more debt for no reason and use the cash for that instead of acquisitions and R&amp;D like they said they would, it may be a concern (that would be reflected on their balance sheet anyway).**Concern 3:** One concern I might have personally is if another company is able to provide the consumables that the Dragonfly needs. Since sales have been lackluster in the past (though they might pick up), NNDM seems to currently rely on the blade portion of their razor/blade model, even though level 1 revenue comes from Dragonfly sales (the razor). Only time will tell if these machines are actually as good as Stern says, but from what I can tell, they are. Although I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs even possible for another company to make a cheaper ink that can be used in the same machine, especially with all of NNDM's patents, but I don‚Äôt understand enough about the patents to determine that. Regardless, I see NNDM as slightly risky (in the event sales don't pick up by EOY 2022) but still and *incredibly* valuable play, especially over the long term. (Anything under 10$ is an absurd deal, even under 15$ in my opinion)**TLDR:** The Dragonfly gives Nano Dimension a competitive advantage via product differentiation in the industry of additive manufacturing and PCBs, while also breaking into a new market with the same product. Additionally giving them a first mover advantage. On top of all that, their current ratio is an absurd 101.13 (Yahoo). Which seems like REALLY solid support for defending those advantages. Nano Dimension is first-to-market with a unique product that disrupts multiple industries, and are trying to keep it that way. Highly recommend watching the 3/11 earnings interview if you skipped down to read the TLDR and haven't seen it yet. WSB doesn't allow youtube links so the title of the video is ""Nano Dimension: CEO Discusses Acquisition Strategy."" Currently have 120 shares @ 8.46 and might get some long term calls as well.**Other Updates:**I've recently been informed of BotFactory as their main competition, so next for me is additional research on this company.

First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the HFs to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their CFO.The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. We obviously don't have a date for this year's meeting but history would tell us it will be some time in June. Obviously, COVID and new leadership could change this date but June is a good time to expect. Let's use June 10 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 11, which is a Sunday, so April 12 would be the earliest day they could announce (they would most likely do this pre or post-market). Moreover, the tenure of the current CEO also lines up with that date. The current CEO is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company til a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly waiting until that date to announce RC as the CEO (thank you to resnole for pointing this out). Perhaps GME is waiting until that date to announce Ryan Cohen as the CEO. That date is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point.As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on MMs for failing to deliver shares. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and RC are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, RC loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said ""I love your shorts."" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know RC is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (RC included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to ""warn"" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.",Im very very concerned that the new shares issue could be issued directly to short sellers of the company. This would invalidate any further upside and hurt all apes!

ViacomCBS (VIAC, VIACB) and Discover (DISCA, DISCB) have taken a beating, driven by share dilution and the  *Archegos* Capital Management liquidation fiasco. The majority of the sell pressure was not organic, but driven by Billions of dollars in block trades that were executed on Friday 3/26.Fast forward to this morning, DISCB rebounded and closed with a 83% INCREASE...and was up over 100% at one point today.

These shares are much more liquid and trade in higher volumes. Since the company‚Äôs Class B shares typically trade with less volume, and insider ownership (%float, more on the in a minute) is higher, this presents a better catalyst for a run-up. Some key metrics:||VIAC|VIACA|DISCA|DISCB||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-||Shares Outstanding|587M|52M|162M|6.5M||Float|555M|555M|447M|447M||% Insider|4.12%|79.4%|2.84%|95%||% Institution|94.6%|16.5%|143.5%|7.4%||Shares Short (%Float)|102M (18.8%)|88k (1.7%)|46M (33%)|1k (0.4%)|As you can see from the above table, both VIACA and DISCB are primarily owned by INSIDERS! This means they are **less likely to sell!** i.e. less liquidity! This means less volume can move the price upwards, evident by DISCB performance today. DISCB Average Volume: 3349 vs. Today:  **1,324,372...a 39445% INCREASE.** Why is VIACA primed to fit the same narrative. The numbers closely match DISCB and we know short interest exists.

I‚Äôve been trading for a few years now and am delighted to have found this community and thoroughly enjoy the discussions here.  I am far from an expert and welcome any and all feedback / criticism on my post.Weed stocks have been my biggest plays so far.  I was fortunate enough to have APHA in my portfolio at a 4.75 cost basis when it shot up early this year.  I wanted to share my belief on another potential big time play in weed stocks.First off, I am one who is very bullish on the weed market in general.  I believe that is the largest untapped market today and things are just getting started.Now into the specific topic for this post:  Greenlane Holdings (GNLN) and KushCo Holdings (KSHB).  These equities trade on the OTC market.Just this morning the two companies announced a merger.  I expect that we will continue to see many more mergers in the sector as companies compete for top dogs in the weed market.  Greenlane and KuschCo both supply packings, papers, THC cartridges, ect. - basically all the little trinkets you‚Äôll find at a smoke shop.  This means they‚Äôre not competing with the growers but still have huge growth potential as the weed market expands.Unlike APHA / TLRY, the companies are headquartered in the U.S. and have much lower market caps.  This gives them more growth potential than the large cap Canadian cannabis companies.  While APHA / TLRY is playing to expand from the more established market of Canada into the more untapped market in the U.S., GNLN / KSHB is an under the radar supplier that is looking to establish a large market presence on its own turf.  But again, GNLN / KSHB is not so much competing with the growers like APHA /TLRY and SNDL.The merger is beneficial for the companies not just because they supply similar products and synergy and yadda yadda, but they also have their own unique supply chains that they can now double dip in.  KSHB operates more as a smoke shop supplier while GNLN has a strong foothold in the e-commerce market.  Working together now, they can potentially capitalize as a supplier to both shops and online customers.With the merger, KSHB will be converted into 0.2546 shares of GNLN.  This ratio is helpful when trying to get the best cost basis.TL;DR:  news of GNLN &amp; KSHB merger could be a nice catalyst for the stocks (similar to news of APHA &amp; TLRY merger).

Then I read between the lines and other boards and I believe they would have outperformed the revenue line if not for the patent sale upcoming.Chen said that yearly income on patents is 250 M$. 250/4= 62.5 M$. Now, look at the deferred revenue line you apes between q4 and q3. It went up 61 million.This is not counted in this quarter's revenue because if they sell the patents this revenue will probably go to the buyer and BB will get what they sell it for.Clearly, people want it to go down but without this patent sale, they would be in line if not outperform the revenue expectation of 246 M$.  **So what about IVY**? The timeframe for the IVY release day is coming sooner than expected! We can expect it in February 2022 which is insane, I was thinking we‚Äôd have to wait many more years to see that released. Yes, you read that right, February 2022!!The thing is, so many people still don‚Äôt know Ivy exists and once we start seeing live demos of Ivy in action I expect new investors to flood in and the price to go up significantly.

"First off, this is not financial advice! We are all gambling for goodness sake (sir, this is a casino). It's called wallstreetBETS for a reason. This is simply my personal opinion and if you read it, COOL! If not, COOL!P.S. I dove head first into the stock market for one reason and one reason only, TO MAKE MONEY! And honestly, I haven't done that at all so I know I belong here! But without further ado:There are two types of people in the sub, 1) people who can effectively analyze the technicals of a stock like GME and 2) liars. There is no way any of you mother effers can account for the volatility of this stock, the amount of holders, the true short interest, and momentum. So take whatever you learned from your little youtube video or on investopedia about your cute Elliott wave theory, fibonacci retracement, and MY FAVORITE ""do you see that cup and handle formation,"" no I don't you idiot, it's like looking at the dam clouds, you can create anything with an imagination! The reason I can say this so confidently is because I was one of the retards that thought I could analyze the stock with my tools only to find out I was wrong every time! I mean I hit some targets, but where there was supposed to be support it fell, where there was supposed to be resistance it broke through, there is no telling where the thing is going (hopefully up).

It is all hypey growth/tech. Also notice that in the week before, RKT went down and hypetech went up (i.e., last week). This cycle has existed since the first bump on 1/27. The play is to accumulate RKT and short hypetech in the cycle before the big bump. At big pump, cover your short and sell a bit of RKT.If I am right, the Big Bust will occur sometime soon.

"Apes, this is just a theory. First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the HFs to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their CFO.The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. We obviously don't have a date for this year's meeting but history would tell us it will be some time in June. Obviously, COVID and new leadership could change this date but June is a good time to expect. Let's use June 10 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 11, which is a Sunday, so April 12 would be the earliest day they could announce (they would most likely do this pre or post-market). Moreover, the tenure of the current CEO also lines up with that date. The current CEO is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company til a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly waiting until that date to announce RC as the CEO (thank you to resnole for pointing this out). Perhaps GME is waiting until that date to announce Ryan Cohen as the CEO. That date is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point.As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on MMs for failing to deliver shares. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and RC are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, RC loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said ""I love your shorts."" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know RC is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (RC included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to ""warn"" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.","How high?What‚Äôs up guys. Not looking for anyone to jump at me.

Note: This is one aspect of making an investment decisions, there are a number of other factors to look at when conducting DDSummary* Valuing companies based on comps is standard practice, and leveraging ratios helps provide a sense of potential investment opportunities.* I looked at these 3 companies to get a sense of which ones might be over or undervalued, as well as which ones might be a riskier investment from a liability standpoint* Analysis is below, but keep in mind these ratios only paint part of the picture to help form an investment thesis.**Definitions** ‚Äì If you know these then skip this part but if not, it is good to have some context in terms of what the ratio mean and what the values indicate.* **Price to Book**: Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value. P/B ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments. P/B ratios under 1 are typically considered solid investments.* **Price to Sales**: The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company‚Äôs stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company‚Äôs sales or revenues. A low ratio could imply the stock is undervalued while a ratio that is higher-than-average could indicate that the stock is overvalued.* **Quick Ratio**: The quick ratio is an indicator of a company‚Äôs short-term liquidity position and measures a company‚Äôs ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The higher the ratio result, the better a company's liquidity and financial health; the lower the ratio, the more likely the company will struggle with paying debts.* **Current Ratio**: The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It tells investors and analysts how a company can maximize the current assets on its balance sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables. A company with a current ratio less than 1.0 does not, in many cases, have the capital on hand to meet its short-term obligations if they were all due at once.* **Debt to Equity**: The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company‚Äôs total liabilities by its shareholder equity. These numbers are available on the balance sheet of a company‚Äôs financial statements. Higher leverage ratios tend to indicate a company or stock with higher risk to shareholders.Summary of RatiosI summarized the ratios in the table below.

"Apes, this is just a theory. First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank. I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the HFs to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their CFO.  The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four AGMs: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. We obviously don't have a date for this year's AGM but history would tell us it will be some time in June. Obviously, COVID and new leadership could change this date but June is a good time to expect. Let's use June 10 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 11, which is a Sunday, so April 12 would be the earliest day they could announce (they would most likely do this pre or post-market). Moreover, the tenure of the current CEO also lines up with that date. The current CEO is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company til a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly waiting until that date to announce RC as the CEO (thank you to resnole for pointing this out). Perhaps GME is waiting until that date to announce Ryan Cohen as the CEO. That date is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on MMs for failing to deliver shares. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account. Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and RC are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, RC loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said ""I love your shorts."" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know RC is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (RC included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to ""warn"" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.",.. like two good friends going together with strong will to reach the moon! üöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çüíéüíéüôåüôåBuy and hold!,"Ok 2 things - very simple. 1. MS sold out of 1/2 billion shares of RKT at 25.25. Why they sold? They probably have a set plan so sell in increments at set prices, they are rotating some money around because of margin call shenanigans, or they want to keep accumulating at lower prices so they made a public scare. 2. The closed above the 8, 20, and 50 EMA on the 4 hour chart. Last time it did that we saw 70% gains. Ok 3 things. We know they will beat ER again and drop some partnership again probably. They are going to get recognized as more than a mortgage company because they can make money when rates are up and down due to their tech. Next Er should prove this. I can‚Äôt seem to think as to why this sell by MS is bad.On a more macro level, you could say consumer lending stocks could dip hard I guess. I don‚Äôt believe this matters. Not only are they not just a mortgage company, but they are a safe play even if they were only a mortgage company because of their ability to utilize tech in high rate environments. Additionally, MBS‚Äôs are actually crash proof now IMO, especially with RKT‚Äôs securitized loans. (They write clean loans which get sold as a portfolio in the secondary market.) People pay their mortgages as a priority, and it‚Äôs not pre Dodd Frank Act anymore so you actually have to qualify thoroughly.  Ok, let‚Äôs say everyone losses their job and can‚Äôt pay their mortgage and RKT goes bankrupt... The funny part is we would probably get over $300 a share due to the amount of assets they have. It‚Äôs comical, that‚Äôs literally how undervalued this company is - According to the stock market they are worth more bankrupt then being fully operating business generating nearly half $1 trillion in revenue in one year (according to their annual report) while rapidly growing/innovating. I can‚Äôt seem to think as to why this sell is a bad. At the end of the day someone bought the shares above 25 while the price sits at 23.8.  Pos: 2k shares and a total of like 250 calls or something - I lost count. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.","Goto GameStop and spend $10,000 on Nintendo Switch‚Äôs, PS5‚Äôs and XBox Ones for charity!","First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit√§t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  ‚ÄúWe are going to deliver the world‚Äôs best software with the world‚Äôs most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that‚Äôs worth to them. And I think you‚Äôll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.‚Äù -Karp the day they went public","Sundial (SNDL) can easily be short squeezed and can be the next GME, it‚Äôs holding up today!",can someone smarter than me explain how this is even possible?!

So today Morgan Stanley privately sold a 20m share block of RKT, one of the highest short interest tickers. We all know it's probably Bill Hwang's holding, hidden in different entity's holdings through equity swaps. I was surprised to find out that he was able to accumulate such a big position relative to the float and hide it. Who knows what else he was hiding other than the ones already publicly sold off, maybe he also had stakes in GME/AMC. Anyways, maybe he was just super cocky and diamond handed all the way to margin call. But what if he had some enemies? He was convicted for insider trading before and probably engaged in all kinds of shady trading tactics. Now if you lost a lot of money to Bill Hwang before and you hear about him leveraging himself 500%, you might decide to go against his positions to bust him. Remember, if Bill Hwang was at such a high leverage, he only have to be down a small fraction of his overall position to be margin called. Maybe the numbers in RKT aren't enough to bust Bill, but perhaps there are several other high interest tickers involved that we haven't found out about yet.If this is the case, maybe the shorts will ramp down?

Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25.2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.https://preview.redd.it/labcy9iyc0q61.jpg?width=742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e399e1b4e36ae992d7a49800a97d43e41f12b815","Now hear me out, I understand the numbers are made available in real time, however they are reported completely out of context.

"Anyone else have Robinhood suddenly sell some of your shares of GME claiming you were ‚Äúin a deficit‚Äù?I just got an email from Robinhood saying that my account was in a deficit, and then half a second later another email saying that they sold one of my GME stocks. I‚Äôve contacted there support on the matter and was given the standard reply of ‚Äúit may take 1-3 days to respond‚Äù","Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. I‚Äôm might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and I‚Äôm like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others.Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air.Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. That‚Äôs what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I don‚Äôt know expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I don‚Äôt think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle.I like movies and I like the stock!üçø üé• üöÄ",RKT Stock Price: $23 Target (Down From $28.81) By Credit SuisseNews reports that Credit suisse has to liquidate 18-20 billion to cover margin calls.  they literally just shorted RKT.

"I‚Äòm tired of people justifying a GME share price of $500+ based off of earnings going up and transitioning into the online business. It simply isn‚Äòt value at that price because it‚Äòs a brick and mortar store and still has to be treated as such(at least for the time being, but I have no doubt it will smash in online sales).For clarification I am absulutely a financial advisor and you should blindly trust people on the internet with your money. I am also interested in the squeeze, but this post does not go into that possibility further, I‚Äòm just talking about fundamental value.I am also in no way throwing shade at the company. I trust it to grow further.Currently sold off all positions in the second squeeze, but will buy back once the price comes down again.Let‚Äòs do some quick math to figure out current value without future predictions:Q1 2021 profit: 80M(2.1B revenue)2021 Profit would be: 4*80M=320MAssuming a P/E ratio of 27 (average for gaming sector) company value would be: 27*320M=8.64BShare price would be: 8.64B/70M(shares outstanding)= $123Current value per share would be $123 per share. I believe earnings will go up with new management, but don‚Äò see GameStop with the same P/E of techy gaming companies yet so I would buy in a bit lower (imho under $100 is definitely a buy, would still go for $110).Assuming growth will continue I fully agree with price predictions displayed in other posts but I would be weary. Ryan Cohen has only just started and we can‚Äòt predict anything. He might grow GameStop like Chewy, he might grow it more or less. Fact is that GME isn‚Äòt worth nearly $500 at the moment and we don‚Äòt know where it‚Äòs going. It doesn‚Äòt make sense to value GameStop like a tech company yet but it‚Äòs getting there. The hype surrounding the company will also help boost sales and share price and Ryan Cohen will boost the company massively. Overall I see it growing to those $500 predictions (growing profits by about 4x again, after 3x-ing since Q4 2020) in a couple years but paying that price in advance is just absurd.tl/dr: based on current sales GameStop is worth about $123 per share. I believe it will go up further but you can‚Äòt value it like a tech company yet (it still being highly dependent on in-store sales)",Where we at ladies and gentlemen with AMC?

Check my track record on here, I'm undefeated and I plan to stay that way.&amp;#x200B; Last week, we saw an idiot go tits up in true WSB fashion, affecting the PB's they did business with. This sent many, many stocks freefalling from ATH's in TMT stocks that they held, including VIAC, BIDU, DISCA, TME, IQ, etc. while pumping S&amp;P stocks because  the short positions Archegos held had to be bought back to close out their fund. Who was the idiot that led the charge? A boy named Bill Huang, a Tiger Cub and blatant price manipulator who was levered 5-6x to 1. **Countless success can turn a man arrogant and greedy, which is what I plan to capitalize on.** I'm here to argue the case that the PB's who liquidated Archegos' holdings, did so with disregard of the stocks' value in relation to price.Before I begin to make my case, I ought to go over the near-term risks associated with opening positions in BIDU and VIAC or any of the stocks that Archegos held positions in, which is contagion risk. Because of the huge sell off in these names and the fact that MM's who invest in TMT tend to invest in all the same asset type, more margin calls can be triggered over the next 2-4 weeks before managers with loads of cash start loading up on these names. So my advice is to load up carefully, unlike Bill Huang, and you will be rich.Now let's get to it then with **Catalysts and Fundamentals** for two of my favorite names Archegos was in: **BIDU AND VIAC**&amp;#x200B;Baidu (BIDU);**Catalysts:** **Baidu's Apollo (Level 4 autonomy) and robotaxis**\-Started its launch in Beijing and has received its first driverless testing permit in California and its 199th driverless permit in China.\- Plans to begin mass production of Kunlun II AI chip later this year, which will be in direct competition with NVDA's chip for autonomous domination in the car market.**Baidu plans to start an EV car company with cars rolling out in 2024.****56.2% ownership stake in IQiyi, China's Netflix**  \-Currently valued at $7.7Billion  \-At IQ's recent high of $30, stake would be worth $13 Billion**Acquisition of YY Live for a measly $3.6Billion will leverage the company's bread and butter of advertising expertise once they acquire the social media app and other assets** **Baidu Core revenue for Q1 2021 will grow between 26% and 39% year over year.**  \-Ad revenue is Baidu's cash flow generating machine which has allowed the company to venture into other areas as mentioned above. Their core business is returning to growth and FCF will be strong.&amp;#x200B;**Fundamentals:**21x trailing P/E or  $3.4billion in net income with $1.4 billion coming from the appreciation of their long term investments, or stakes in companies like IQIYI2020 FCF of $2.9BillionForecasting 10-20% full year revenue growth as China returns quicker than the US due to low covid cases and the Chinese govt's bark will be larger than their bite as they will try to prop up their economy this year.$5.5 billion in cash with a .74 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is beautiful.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;ViacomCBS (VIAC);**Catalysts:****Streaming service release with an expectation of an initial boom.****Share price has been absolutely battered this month, falling 50% from ATH's****Domestic Streaming &amp; Digital Video Revenue Growth to 72% Year-Over-Year in Q4, Driven by Strong Streaming Subscription and Streaming Advertising Revenue** &amp;#x200B;**Fundamentals:**11x trailing P/E or $2.6 billion in net incomeFCF of $1.9 billion or 15x trailing $3 billion in cash with a 2.0 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is normal for a media company.Compared to DIS multiples, VIAC is extremely cheap and you get a free buy-in for their streaming service.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Positions:Baidu: 9/21 $230c, 1/22 $230cViacomCBS: 4/21 $50c, 1/22 $50c &amp;#x200B;The main reason I am loading up here is because this is so reminiscent of what happened because of the mass defaults that occurred in the housing crisis we saw in the US in 07-09. The difference here is that the assets that were sold off were firm-specific to Archegos' holdings. Bill Huang may have been a cheater and extremely greedy, but due to the recent sell off at fire sale prices, I believe these two stocks that his family office held have tremendous upside. And as I said with my CRSR posting a few months ago, if you inverse me here, I will crush you.Godspeed, retards.",,,,,,,

Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services.

Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices.

"If we're about to pull the rug from under their feet \*again\* it might as well be today, since the theaters are now openThoughts?",&amp;#x200B;https://i.redd.it/yevpaky066q61.gif,,"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.Just imagine this, Tesla only has **&lt;2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **&gt;175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world. With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).",,,,,,,,,,,

"I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it‚Äôs amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn‚Äôt want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn‚Äôt stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.And it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don‚Äôt even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it.

"When I look at the front page of WSB these days all I see are a bunch of virgins collectively asking, ""daddy, when is GME going to moon?"" Or, ""daddy, is the squeeze szuoze yet?"" Looking for reassurance and constantly refreshing WSB to feed your confirmation bias is not as good thing for sentiment. If you are cock sure about GME hitting $42069 then you don't need to read every goddamn comment on the daily GME thread or read every crayon laden TA post that tells you GME will moon on X date. Why is there such a need to have constant reassurance about GME mooning? Is it a possible FUD strategy? Think about it; you're conditioned to log on to WSB and get an instant dopamine hit because you saw a post about how GME is gonna moon any second now. What happens if this stretches on for months or even years? People might lose interest and, God forbid, exit their positions. GME is shaping up to be a solid long term play regardless of the short squeeze potential. Quit needing constant reassurance, it makes us look unsure and insecure.

GME Stocks HODL since Jan' 21,In this rigged market chasing high flying names could be very risky. Finding value stocks are not easy as big money started rotating from growth to value. Kodak is an unique combination of blue chip brand name and micro cap. It is clear that the company want to turn around to grow its business.

"Just got off work at Wendy's, smoked a bowl, and now I am chilling here vibing to the thought of GME and the non-institutional sentiment around it currently. I own 20 shares at $220 avg. that I have accumulated since January 28th and me and my **Diamond Dickbeaters** are not going anywhere. (did not average down at forty, but averaged up on second moon mission because I am retarded)At the Wendy's I work at, I know alot of the other burger flippers that did not get in GME the first or second time the price mooned. Now they're constantly telling me, though I do not give a fuck, ""man if it hits below $XXX.XX again I am definitely going to get some shares this time"". In my head I think *you would just paperhand the shit anyways.* However, I know that if it dips like that again this entire subreddit will flood the fucking gates. FOMO will re-engage and the ""third times a charm"" Burger Flippers will pile in as well. This sort of goes with what Cuban said about the lower it goes the more dangerous retail and WSB becomes. The way I see it, it wont create less Diamond Hands, but more. Day by day, GME prevails against wild market conditions and my smoothbrain flirts with my diamond dickbeaters to keep SLAPPING THAT ASK! Every blatant ladder attack since the beginning of March GME recovered from the BTFD crew, and new domestic or Europoor autists turning into Apes by yoloing crazy amounts. So I ask, how much longer until GME's price is not looked at as artificial by the institutions only held up by the thought of a short squeeze? I know the possibility is there, but even without it I do not feel that retarded thinking I have a good position. I have conviction in this play.   I look at TSLA and think back to all the FUD it got and short selling pressure, but it just kept going.

PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE YOUR OWN INVESTMENTS BASED ON THAT RESEARCH.That being said here we go.The DTCC has released new rules that essentially will split the bill with hedges and clearing houses etc. Now even the NSCC is trying to put out rules to split their bill too. The NSCC new rulings are set for 4/21. Time is running out for the companies to cover losses, THE DTCC, NSCC and more.Why?Mid March they found out the entire market is a fucking ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The US govt literally handed free money to hedges to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. That was the hedges job during the virus. Now on the 31st coming up that money is gone, no more, the rule is expiring and they won't be funded anymore. (Unless extended)Who are they?The DTCC is essentially the worlds largest bank give or take handling over 90% of all existing US money. They are the only people who receive ALL MARKET DATA meaning they don't have to guess about anything they have every bit of info they need on these hedges positions.Why would they do this?There's massive upside for many many stocks bc of the amount of free money pumped into hedges during the pandemic. This of course went to shorting an absolutely shit ton of stocks as we all know. Then the stimulus checks have essentially pumped more money into the hands of individuals then there has ever been before. This combined with the hedges free money disappearing the 31st can cause massive damage to the DTCC possibly for more than they are willing to depart with.How do we know hedges are in danger?Tiger LLC and Goldman Sachs have both been 'margin called' and liquidated over 10B dollars in assets for underlying hedges. This margin call on Goldman is ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGIN CALLS IN HISTORY. Tiger and Goldman both had high stakes in Chinese companies and US Media networks. For an example of what liquidation does to a stock refer yourself to VIACOM the price has drop over 50% in days due to liquidating positions. (Possible Distraction?)What does it all mean?IMO we've managed to scare the largest bank in the world, THE DTCC, they see their wellbeing at risk and are acting as fast as possible to split the bill with as many people as possible before shit really hits the fan and stocks like AMC/GME have INNNSAAAANE UPSIDE POTENTIAL come to be realized.TLDR: THE DTCC IS FUCKING TERRIFIED OF US APES.

From what I can gather it is an electronic quotation service provided by FINRA, and apparently it only deals with selling trade data of certain stocks to those who are subscribed to their service. But my question is: If it is only a data trading service, why would it be showing up on the Level II data like that? Is this somehow their way of extracting data from the stock market? By holding a position, listing an exorbitant sell price of $1,000,000.00 that no one would actually buy, collecting the data, and cancelling the order?

"Here is a link to the order by the SEC:  [https://www.sec.gov/rules/ic/2021/ic-34173.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/ic/2021/ic-34173.pdf)  Citadel filed an application on December 18, 2020 for an exemption from ""all provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, except section 9 and sections 36 through 53 and the rules and regulations under those sections.""  The link to that filing can be found on the Federal Register here:  [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/28/2020-28492/citadel-enterprise-americas-llc-formerly-citadel-llc-and-ceif-llc-notice-of-application](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/28/2020-28492/citadel-enterprise-americas-llc-formerly-citadel-llc-and-ceif-llc-notice-of-application)  I have some work obligations today so I do not have time to break this down in great detail - but here are the highlights.  The Investment Security Act of 1940 is summarized in Investopedia as follows:  ""What Is the Investment Company Act of 1940?The Investment Company Act of 1940 is an act of Congress which regulates the organization of investment companies and the activities they engage in, and sets standards for the investment company industry. The legislation in the Investment Company Act of 1940 is enforced and regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp). This legislation defines the responsibilities and requirements of investment companies and the requirements for any publicly-traded investment product offerings, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and unit investment trusts. The Act primarily targets publicly-traded retail investment products.""  The link to the full act can be found here:  [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1879/pdf/COMPS-1879.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1879/pdf/COMPS-1879.pdf)There are a bunch of other acts out there from which stems a litany of regulatory and case law - but as far as black letter statutory law - this statute is the grandfather and ultimate authority for much of our modern investment entity regulation (i.e. it supersedes case law and regulatory law that directly stems from/takes its authority from the black letter law).  While there are other statutes the govern the industry - granting an exemption from any of this black letter law is a big deal (from which stem other regulations and case law).  So what specifically have they been exempted from?  &amp;#x200B;According to the SEC order on January 13, 2021 (linked above) the December 18, 2021 (also linked above - apparently they filed on December 13 - but for some reason the published date is December 18 - they probably amended after the initial filing) - they have been exempted from:  ""Citadel Enterprise Americas LLC and CEIF LLC filed an application on December 13, 2019, and amended on May 7, 2020, July 10, 2020, and October 15, 2020, requesting a superseding order that amends and restates a prior order under sections 6(b) and 6(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (‚ÄúAct‚Äù) granting an exemption from all provisions of the Act, except section 9, and sections 36 through 53, and the rules and regulations thereunder. With respect to sections 17 and 30 of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and rule 38a-1 under the Act, the exemption is limited as set forth in the application.""&amp;#x200B;A plain reading of Citadel's application reveals that their petition was granted in full ""limited as set forth in the application.""  I don't have time to do a deep dive on the limitations or each section they have been exempted from - but lets hit the highlights:  1. THEY HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE ACT2. THEY ARE EXEMPTED FROM SECTION 34 (page 89 in the pdf linked above) WHICH PROHIBITS THE DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS  TL;DR  Citadel has been granted an exemption by the SEC from the majority of the black letter law in one of the biggest statutes that governs their operations effective January 13, 2021.  THIS INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FROM RULES AGAINST THE DESCTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS.    My take:  This should give us the opposite of FUD.  This should give us ACD - Anger, Confidence, and Diamond Hands.  ALL CREDIT TO u/Noderpsy for digging this up.  His OP on r/GME uncovered the January 13, 2021 SEC order.

"Blink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.      The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is  the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of  growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.üíéüôåBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million.

We don't have an AMC here. When I walked in I noted that the arcade room in the left side was empty. My initial thought was. What a waste of space and money. I think it would make a ton of sense to replace the arcades in some movie theaters with GME stores or just add some GME stores to AMC theaters. Why would I do that?Many people who goes to the movies are also the ones who buy GME merchandise.If you go to visit a GME store and find out about the movies you may end up watching more movies. Many stores have plenty of parking. Make easy for parents to take kids to either AMC theater or GME store.We all grow up going to the movies with our parents, friends and family. We build good memories doing that. With a GME store right there it is like all that candy in the check out lane in a supermarket. Got the spirit. What a better way to build brand loyalty than building great memories !!!If both companies do well. We the stock holders will do well. I will keep trading stocks with both AMC and GME with years to come. After the squeeze happens I will likely sell covered calls and cash covered put on both and add to my positions on both with that. Why? Because I too like the stock !!!But until that happens and if it happens I will continue to buying and hold on both until both squeezes come!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592caIt also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**TL;DR** Bears need $170 or below by EOW to gain the upperhand leading into next week. If it ends \~$180-$190, good chance we don't see too much of a change next week, maybe a bit of downward pressure. If we hit $250 by EOW, we **might** see something big happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I set my GME sell limit to 100,000 Robinhood didn't accept, so I set it to 10,000, RH still didn't accept so I tried 5000 and it finally accept.I think if everyone set their limit to 5k it will have lots of potential. Former amazon executive was hired by gamestop, amazon is currently 3k per share. Gamestop is now a meme stock and we all know its strongly targeted by hedge funds. Put and A+B=C and you have huge potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm curious what folks who are long GME think happens when Gamestop accelerates and goes 100% digital? Why do you think that is good for Gamestop? I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short. I'm just watching it all with fascination. I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty. You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD? Zero. Not even 1 penny. Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store. Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5. Same with Microsoft. Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game. Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT. So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games. Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games. But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that. Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues. They explained it as, ""Look, we have millions of customers, we have their data, we know their address and emails...we can leverage that to help Activision make more money. So...we want a slice of your digital download business."" When my team heard about this, (we were in a conference room, waiting for a meeting to start), first, we all started laughing. After about 5 minutes of laughing and making jokes, we got serious. Why would we give any our of revenues to GME? We don't need to do that. They weren't clear on how they could leverage the customer data to our benefit. Someone made a good point: would GME give us a slice of their used physical game business? Because that is huge margins for GME. They buy your used physical game for like $5 or $10, and put it on the shelf as a used game for like $20 or $25. Great margins! Would they give us a piece of their used game business? No way. They don't need Activision to do their used game business, why should they give us any of that revenue? Same for digital. We don't need GME to sell digitally, and, we already pay a 30% platform fee to Sony and MSFT, why would we give GME a piece of the digital rev? So, I don't understand how Cohen will transform GME. If you agree that physical games are going away, and digital and streaming is the future...then GME is a dinosaur. I don't see it succeeding, but I could be wrong. Think of this. GME just posted their 9th straight declining quarter of revenues. In a COVID year where people are home, you have their undivided attention, AND new hardware launch of PS5 and new XBOX, they still posted declining rev. When new consoles come out, once every 8 years or so, you should be posting huge revenue increases, not decreases. They still went down in rev. This upcoming Xmas, with no new hardware launch that I'm aware of, I can't see their rev's going up. What am I missing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, GameStop acquired Ryan Cohen, the CEO of Chewy. There is no doubt in my mind that Cohen isn't going to transform the fundamentals of GameStop for the better. On top of this, the company also acquired executives from both Amazon and Google. The company plans to fix their e-commerce situation as well as branch out into selling PC gaming material. Also, the company is dipping their toes into hosting e-sports tournaments. So, do I think the stock could potentially go up to $500? Yes. Do I think that will happen over night? No. This will all be gradual, and if the fundamentals do end up strengthening, then there will be no need for the stock to ever dip down to under $100 ever again.

"TLDR; GME *may not be* the cause of the downturn and liquidation that we're seeing. Big players may be looking to *cause* a downturn for many reasons:1. Money.2. It covers asses.3. It more easily shifts blame.4. It may make some sell early.5. It may cause some to get margin called.Hello everybody,I am a first-time poster and very new trader, and I do not have much skin in the game because my wife's boyfriend told her not to give me too much money. Criticize me all you want, and criticize my shitty username even more. I have, however, taken it as a challenge to grow a small sum into as much as I can with the riskiest plays possible. GME and AMC are about 90% of my holdings now, partially because I used to consider them high risk/high reward, and partially because I believe a crash is coming and AMC/GME are potential hedges against it due to the short interest.I do not know much about finance. I am not a financial advisor. Almost everything in this post is conjecture, and any perceived criticisms, accusations, or sentiments are not leveled at any specific person, group, or business in particular. I use intentionally vague language for a reason, and that reason is that I do not much at all of the inner-workings of this. This entire post is almost entirely fiction based on a narrative I know very little about.My first degree was in social sciences, so my thoughts and opinions in this matter are primarily focused on what is essentially the battle that is happening, rather than the finance side of the issues. I believe that this is fitting, as GME is currently detached from financial rules/norms to some extent and highly rooted in sentiment and a mental game of encouraging sell-offs and buy-ins. As some have probably already noted, this saga is becoming more and more psychological as time goes on:* Progressively more sophisticated FUD campaigns* Bad Faith Actors* News Manipulation* Short Ladder AttacksThe reason I am doing this is because I have learned more in the last 2 months than I have ever before, almost completely thanks to WSB and other finance subs. I want to pay the Reddit community back by promoting discussion and potentially spurring new theories so somebody can really nail down what's happening with this phenomenon. My apologies about the scattered thoughts on this matter, it came to me as a possibility in the shower this morning.&amp;#x200B;**Why would anybody want to crash the market preemptively?**Simply, **money**. The loss of money from a down market may not outweigh the loss from short fees, particularly if one were to cash out early. If multiple parties are involved, if one group is first to realize this strategy, they can liquidate and make more than others. If the group knows a crash is coming either way, they can make money on it by being the genesis of it (Think ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù). If groups are beginning to see that they have to liquidate either way, they will do so earlier rather than later in order to capitalize.Of course, this is (probably) a last ditch strategy for many reasons, but that may be where the saga is at this current point in time as other methods of trying to kill off the share price have clearly not worked.  **The covering of asses.**If the market downturn were to occur closer to the GME squeeze hiting its apex (i.e. groups liquidate to pay the expense), the focus of policy makers would be on how GME got to the point it could crash the market. It makes the cause (GME exploding) very clear to the effect (the market crashing).If the market downturn were to occur well beforehand, then other factors can be blamed. Potentially, this can take the focus away from the short interest GME has taken on, and now allows the onus to shift to other potential factors, such as gross overvaluation of some sectors/stocks, general short interest within the markets, etc. This is a good thing for some as it helps those that have been engaging in shady investment practices obfuscate their actions and motives. If the end result means jail time for some, then the crashing of the market  is something that has already been considered.**The shifting of blame.**In hand with the covering of asses, more factors (not just GME Short &gt; GME up &gt; Have to pay the shorts &gt; Liquidate &gt; Market Crash) allow blame to be shifted more easily for the same reasons.If the market is already going down, then why not spread uncertainty about why?**An early sell off of GME.**If my life savings are thrown into any degree of investments and my car breaks down, if we‚Äôre in the middle of a crash, where would I pull money from to fix it? Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt normally pull it from a blue chip that will recover, I‚Äôd pull from a FOMO stock that is still doing well that I would want to realize some degree of profits from anyways. To that point, if I have used GME as a hedge, why wouldn‚Äôt somebody choose to cash in on that hedge while it is still going strong compared to the rest of the market? Leaving a certain amount of time between the crash and the boom of GME allows for more shares to reenter the float.**Margin calls for retail investors.**With point 4, other stocks dropping could cause people to get margin called, forcing them to liquidate their positions in GME. This could create the opportunity to buy short positions back at a lower price, which is the goal for these groups that are already forced to pay too much.&amp;#x200B;In short, I feel like we're getting close to endgame because of the current confluence of events. Do I have a timeline on it? No, not at all.What do I mean by the confluence of events?1. The NSCC/DTCC/FICC ruling. This indicates big things may be coming.2. The margin call of Archegos. Not much is known about further holdings, but this presents an opportunity to shift blame from GME S.I. elsewhere.3. Overvaluation with inflation worries.4. The dying off of FOMO. In essence, the real diamond handers have been weeded from the rest.5. Rapidly building interest on the shorts.What else will endgame look like? I haven't the foggiest clue, but the lack of short ladder attacks these last two days is (in my opinion) the calm before the storm. If I had to guess, we may see another huge attack coupled with something made to instill panic (such as a market crash).While I have the platform, a couple other thoughts:The sheer fact that the psychological campaign is happening against the DD writers, WSB board, etc, means there‚Äôs truth in this somewhere. Personally, if nothing were happening to GME and its proponents, I would pull. That there was such huge resistance on a number of levels means a group does not want people talking about GME, writing DD, etc. In addition to that, I know that if I get hate on this thread or in my inbox, I know I‚Äôll be on to something.Perhaps I will add more onto my post later, but as of right now I just want to throw this out there and see the response. Let‚Äôs discuss!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hello Apes and hedgies, this is my first attempt at a TA and i will be utilizing technical indicators. So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.&amp;#x200B;**THE MACD**&amp;#x200B;So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.&amp;#x200B;**THE RSI**&amp;#x200B;The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. &amp;#x200B;Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/xxc0xape67q61.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f67f9e4a093ae8d67ebf00095811fbd4b43522This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/v1hs1l3t67q61.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78546e0cb8cdbf23b62b9cedb4c7518ec212e314This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ae0zxgk377q61.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ce4b7b779155d92aa6f8fb4a1c43c7b68a58fd6This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next?

"There is a lot of talk about ""being good people"" when we moon from GME but when I post a question to try and help people in my life who are unaware of GME, my post gets removed from r/GME which is sad to see, I am just looking for answers. There are people in my life that I cannot convince to invest in GME. Does that mean I want them to suffer? Absolutely not. What the fuck is wrong with people. The only people I want to suffer are the hedgefunds, not normal people.Although my portfolio is 100% GME across 3 brokers, I can't convince my family members. I can't blame them, as they're from an older generation and do not really understand what is going on. Despite this, I do not want to see people close to me suffer as a result of hedgies completely fucking over the market to cover their positions.They're mainly invested in things like Tesla, NVidia, SPY and other boomer-type stocks. I don't know much other than GME and told them maybe water ($AWK) would be a good idea. They think gold/silver. Any advice would be great.As for me, I am hodling to the moon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this shortAnybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4aA lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of handFor most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6dbGamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.# This is not an investmentThe stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Alright apes, I am loaded up on Potassium and going to dumb down this entire GameStop situation and loosely explain in my opinion. We all heard of Tulip mania, but lets step that shit up to Pok√©mon TCG mania level. Story time; not number time. Keep in mind, Pok√©mon = GME in this story.Pok√©mon came out in 1999, folks went crazy over it, and become a commodity investment for many. Come a few years later, the craze dies down, and that huge value which was market wise for cards has died down. I‚Äôm sure many of y‚Äôall remember but the masses wrote off Pok√©mon; you go to any hobby store and try to sell your stuff, they offered pennies on the dollar or wont buy at all.¬†Most folks toss the cards away, including me (fuck me, 1st edition raichu holo that would pay for my kids college, used as some hamster bedding). Then there were some who said fuck no, this has value. Either store it away, or keep collecting.Fast forward a decade or so, add some Elliot wave theory, and here we are today. Have you see the value of that shit in the last months or years? A box of original factory sealed booster packs went for $150,000+ In recent times.¬†TL;DR:¬†Don‚Äôt repeat history, the market markers aka hobby stores discounted Pok√©mon to oblivion to where it was dead; like GME. Here we are and its a fucking rebirth, prices skyrocketed, there is exponential demand, and little supply; prices moon.¬†",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" TLDR: keep at least 1 share. keep 2 or 3 if you have alot of themAlready so everybody knows it's about buy and hold. and everybody want's to be rich and burn the shorts. You always have to think ""what next?""Info:1)EVERYBODY wants money, even the shorts, and they will play all the tricks they got. Illegal and Legal. No news we all have seen it.2) This is a War. Shorts vs Longs (everyone should read ""The art of War - by Sun Tzu. Best book for everything in your life)3) What is our fuel? - 200% to 2000% short rate - EVERY SHARE HOLDED MATTERS4) Their strenghts? - knowlege; softwares; teams; capital; tricks and manipulation; power;5) their weakness? - Dept; greed; leverage; regulations; alot of different tickers to cover; It's their home and they need it to live; And now, Chaos6) Our strenghts? - Time; no extra costs; upper hand; 1 goal (squeeeezeeee); the actual shares; Free knowlege; big whales7) our weakness? - paperhands that trade and get scared (me in the past - regret) ; sometime chaos; no knowlege sinse it's their market; no vision (alot of people will sale before 1k)Alright, sorry for this info, but what is my point? I have 3 points:1. They can keep draggins this for months- years, IF people trade. They can buy 1M shares a day... 10M shares a day, if people sold. they own 2000% shares? alright... 10M a day, 100 days = 1B shares1 FUCKING BILION SHARES with 10M shares a day (average day is 15M shares traded). That is why it's SO FUCKING IMPORTANT not to trade, because they can pay back little by little (like you asking for a House Loan to the bank, and then paying month after month for 50 years)Not only that, but if they keep dragging it, they make money along the way (same way. you work, you get paid, you pay or bills. next month same thing)2) So yhea, everybody HOLD, they get fucked, their invester cutted (happening right now with banks)... And they get called, and cover their shorts... IT'S DONE RIGHT? FUCK NOOO!!! - IT'S NOT DONE!!In order for them to buy, people have to sell... they could buy the 2000% shares for 1$ each if people sold at that price. WE ARE THE PEOPLE - WE MAKE THE PRICEPeople will get scared! ""from 5k to 1k? oh shiiit!!!i better sell before it gets even lower! 1k is enough for me!""People that never saw money, will get crazy with 500k in a day, will sell!! (500k is alot right? well if you have 100 shares, it's only 5k/share... not much)You see... in the End game, it's a team game ""The enemy of my enemy, it's my friend"". Sure, there will be chaos, there will be sellfishness... It's all normal, we are all humans... that's why we need to be selfish but smart!! If we think alone, we will sell first then the rest... there is no rush in selling. I will tell them when they can suck my dick, no rush... and I'll thell by how muchI want to sell at 1M a share? I'll put a sell order at 5M! Do you really think they gonna let you sell the price you want? it will reach 999K and fall to 1k. And you will sell, why? - Because it was so close... you can lose 100k... better than nothing right? sure... but you just lost! and everyone that wanted to sell at 1M or higher. It's all mental, and we are common/basic. We all have the same price target, it's easy to predict3) Final point, sorry guys. KEEP ONE SHARE. They need to buy those 55M shares. There is not enough illegal, corrupt shit they can to, to erase 55M shares. They can ""delete"" the extra shares that don't exist, they can do whatever the fuck they want. But those 55M shares (not even one less, because they can trade that 1 floating share, 100000000000x times, and get free) Will need to be covered.End game, everybody is selfish and wants their milion... That 1 share that you don't sell, will get you EVERYTHING and its the only way to make sure everybody sells fucking high. And it's our job, to make sure each one of us makes our part part. Do it for yourself!""But I can sell that share for an extra 5M"" - Fuck it, set you target price 5M Higher on the other shareLet's burn the roof, the floor, the walls! We want blood and money $$$$Ps. Our taxes will pay for all the inocente people that will get burn in the processI can lose whatever I have invested, it's all profits from the past. I'm not leaving without enough money to build schools, build shelters, build a better society, and invest in green energys. 1M is not allot, we just think it is because we are poor!sorry for bad english, not native",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"‚ÄúYou buy low (the dip), you hold, and after the squeeze you sell‚Äù. Simple ü¶ç math!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've been told that my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maxt80/gme_poker_cannibalism_and_why_the_apes_are_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) was some financial fan-fiction fuckery, so here's something a bit more down to the moon for you apes:**Why I'm not going to attempt to sell any portion of my GME positions in an effort to cover my initial investment, and why you should fear selling too early far more than selling too late.**(1) I believe that the long term value of GME, let's say within two to three years, is at least three to five times its current price, e.g. at least $600-$900 per share.  Why?  In short, I believe in Cohen's transformation thesis.  So literally doing nothing but holding until then will be profitable, which is why I'm not planning to sell any portion of my positions just to cover my initial investment.(2) I believe that while retail almost certainly cannot initiate the squeeze, due to real-time buying volume requirements, retail owns enough shares to effectively determine how high the price goes.  Why? Simple supply &amp; demand dynamics.  The intrinsic value of the shares at this point is not relevant.  All that matters is what retail wants to charge.(3) I believe that most retail investors are not in this for a small profit, but instead for a life changing amount of money and sending a message to the street.So if during the squeeze the max price is in retail's hands, how high can the price go?  This now becomes a question of human behavior as opposed to anything strictly financial or technical.  In this context, I believe that the single most important factor is fear.What does retail fear more?  (1) Selling too early, or  (2) Selling too late.Typically ""dumb money""--that's what the street calls us--fears selling too late, because instead of trying to maximize gains, they want to minimize the downside of what could happen if they wait to close out their positions.  Minimizing losses certainly makes sense if you're on a short term play with a well defined risk to return ratio or when you have a hypothesis that get invalidated; however, when it comes to being long, especially when you decide the fucking price, greed is good.If you believe in Ryan Cohen and the transformation of Gamestop, you should fear selling too early far more than selling too late.  You will still profit.  Okay, great, but now the fear of selling too late shifts from not covering one's initial investment to the potential opportunity cost of missing the peak, thereby getting less of a return.  No one knows what the peak will be, which is precisely why you should wait and see and sell after the peak.  Patience is key.  Time is your friend.  **TL;DR**Any shareholder at this point will make money in the long run, even if they ""miss"" the squeeze, so this is why I'm not going to sell any portion of my positions early on in an attempt to cover my initial investment.You should fear selling too early instead of selling too late.  No one knows what the peak will be, which is precisely why you should wait and see and sell after the peak.***HYPE before FUD.***  ***Shares before options.***  ***Moon before sell.*** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üíé üôåüèª üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE YOUR OWN INVESTMENTS BASED ON THAT RESEARCH.That being said here we go.The DTCC has released new rules that essentially will split the bill with hedges and clearing houses etc. Now even the NSCC is trying to put out rules to split their bill too. The NSCC new rulings are set for 4/21. Time is running out for the companies to cover losses, THE DTCC, NSCC and more.Why?Mid March they found out the entire market is a fucking ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The US govt literally handed free money to hedges to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. That was the hedges job during the virus. Now on the 31st coming up that money is gone, no more, the rule is expiring and they won't be funded anymore. (Unless extended)Who are they?The DTCC is essentially the worlds largest bank give or take handling over 90% of all existing US money. They are the only people who receive ALL MARKET DATA meaning they don't have to guess about anything they have every bit of info they need on these hedges positions.Why would they do this?There's massive upside for many many stocks bc of the amount of free money pumped into hedges during the pandemic. This of course went to shorting an absolutely shit ton of stocks as we all know. Then the stimulus checks have essentially pumped more money into the hands of individuals then there has ever been before. This combined with the hedges free money disappearing the 31st can cause massive damage to the DTCC possibly for more than they are willing to depart with.How do we know hedges are in danger?Tiger LLC and Goldman Sachs have both been 'margin called' and liquidated over 10B dollars in assets for underlying hedges. This margin call on Goldman is ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGIN CALLS IN HISTORY. Tiger and Goldman both had high stakes in Chinese companies and US Media networks. For an example of what liquidation does to a stock refer yourself to VIACOM the price has drop over 50% in days due to liquidating positions. (Possible Distraction?)What does it all mean?IMO we've managed to scare the largest bank in the world, THE DTCC, they see their wellbeing at risk and are acting as fast as possible to split the bill with as many people as possible before shit really hits the fan and stocks like GME have INNNSAAAANE UPSIDE POTENTIAL come to be realized.TLDR: THE DTCC IS FUCKING TERRIFIED OF US APES.

"# October 2020 CatalystThe OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:&amp;#x200B;[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and HydrogenOn the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation &amp; Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:&amp;#x200B;[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)&amp;#x200B;The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.&amp;#x200B;As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# TL;DR\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ&amp;#x200B;*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Not sure how relevant it is to know that there are now 51 ETF's to short instead of 47, but more importantly, I found a ""Days to Cover"" count down for ETF's that have GME in them.

"I was in my account so decided to check on GME price and plugged into the bottom ribbon.  Was pretty shocked to see it at $9.94 and thought I hit the wrong symbol.  But it shows a change of -173.81(-94.59%).  From there, I hit the trade button...'cause why not buy more?  But the trade page that came up showed the same price a google search showed, which is $181.00.Went back down to the bottom ribbon and put  in GME again and got the $181.00.  Just for fun, went out and back in and got the $9.94.  And I'm positive that was Gamestop the second time.So after hours shenanigans??  Glitch in the ribbon info at schwab.com??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You guys really got to give the guys like Trey and Andrew (a data scientist, SILICON Valley) the credibility they deserve for the time and information that they curate for us to provide videos with knowledge about the squeezes. I don‚Äôt get it, people are so naive and greedy in today‚Äôs society. It‚Äôs like they expect someone to say something one day and get rich on the next day or not a set schedule. If that‚Äôs how anything worked, then everyone would be RICH af SWIMMING in TENDIES! Point is, believe in the opportunity that is the inevitable gamma and short squeeze that will come at some point, and know that the fundamentals are lined up to possibly squeeze on certain dates, anything that is stopping it is ILLEGALLY being done being our backs and we never know the truth. the 4 HODLmen aren‚Äôt lying to us, y‚Äôall bears are just wrongfully hating on their work because the Hedgies are illegally altering the stock in some way. Look at the amount of change that has come out of this movement, this is HISTORY. People will later see this as the great AMC/GME Squeeze and YOU will be DUMB enough to not believe in the DD and information that is being uncovered here by some DiamondHand geniuses online. Don‚Äôt just be a hater, why not support it? And if you don‚Äôt wanna support it, why hate it? Most BEARS are RETAIL INVESTORS too (we are trying to support you guys too)! If we win then you guys can win just as easily too, so why not believe, why not win? Know that the Hedge Funds are suffering tremendously right not, in fact way worse than us. BILLIONS!! And crazy enough, they have been patient enough to hold their millions and millions of naked shorts, whereas we sell for a -20% TEMPORARY GAIN! Look at GME, it recovered back up to near 200s after tanking almost 50% after and from the first squeeze dropping to 40, you would‚Äôve made all of your money if not more if you bought back in or held!! See, ONLY IF you just held till now!! It just takes patience! Those who do believe and believed in January before the naked shorting, new laws, and Dark Pool Trading were even known about ARE MAKING MONEYYYYYYY! THIS THING IS CRAZY!!!This is not financial advice, I am by no means a financial advisor. The opinions expressed are based on personal information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every time I bought stocks in the last 3 years, they went down almost instantly! GME is the first stock I ever bought that shot straight up after buying! So I basically went around my whole portfolio and sold 95% of each stock to poor into GME. Now after all that work, my GME stocks are down in the red! When that happened, I thought I‚Äôm right back where I started from again. In the red! But I feel a different Aura with GME, I feel like I made a great decision but still get overwhelmed with its volatility. I didn‚Äôt buy GME for short, I thought this is a great long hold opportunity and I‚Äôm excited about the future and bullish about the stock! All my other stocks were good picks for long run but I think GME beats all of them hands down. So if you bought GME and you‚Äôre down to, I hope you‚Äôll get encouraged because, most of you bought on a whim based on other people‚Äôs DD and there DD became your DD. Does this make you a dummy? No it makes you a special kind of retard, a unique retard! Smarter folk put in all the hard work (DD) and your riding on there knowledge. So your Skeptical right now, I get it! But since you now hold, don‚Äôt throw it all away when you see massive drops, instead buy more! If you can‚Äôt buy more, simply find something to do other then watching it all day, because that can discourage you and you might pull the trigger to sell and lose it all. I hope this encourages you and you have an awesome day! Tomorrow is a new day and it will be blessed no matter what happens.Start your day with prayer so you‚Äôre protected and everything that tries to come against you will fail!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hello fellow Apes,I was hoping to seek the wisdom of a silver back for a thought exercise.I think there is a high probability that some manipulation is occurring (e.g. mass orchestrated sell off).  But it seems like the big dogs have tricks up their sleeves that they use frequently with no significant consequence.As retail investors, what strategies exist besides buying and hodling?For instance, what would happen if all retail investors coincidentally purchased one share within a relatively small time window, rather than being distributed throughout one trading day?  Would there be any after effect or consequences to the stock?Does the retail community even have large enough of an influence to make a noticeable dent?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME has ruined my weekends.  All I Think about is getting back on my desktop at work and HODLING  while I watch this saga play out.  I‚Äôm aware this is not healthy LOL.  I‚Äôm an avid exerciser and enjoy the outdoors.  The weather is even getting warmer these days.  But nothing is curbing my appetite for what is next for the stonk we call GME.   Wondering what the rest of you are doing on the weekends to cope with the massive void left in us while we wait for launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I've heard &amp; even relayed the argument that ""*it gives shorts data that can be used against us*"", but I don't think it's a coherent response, though I'd love to hear a good defense of why it is. Hedge funds are sophisticated entities that have access to the type of real-time/up-to-date  financial data &amp; trading tools that make manipulation of markets possible. How reasonable is it to believe they don't already know what retail's holdings are? I think it's very unreasonable. If it's true that they already know, &amp; given that we *don't*, the asymmetry therein  only disadvantages retail.Many have also bought into the thesis that this war is being fought above our heads between large institutions, &amp; the prevailing sentiment is that our side has the overwhelming advantage. Alongside this is the belief that retail holdings are inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, i.e. our holdings are so small that even if we all sold, long hedge funds could still force the squeeze and/or increased retail buying over the short-term isn't enough to have a significant effect on the outcome. The way I see it, if you hold either or both of these positions, there's still no room for the belief that it would be detrimental for retail to estimate its holdings. I'd love to hear thoughtful feedback of any kind. Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hyperinflation market crash. Why Goldman Sachs is liquidating positions and why Warren Buffett is sitting on a mountain of cash when he could of bought in last March.If you haven‚Äôt been living under a rock you know that Michael Burry was preaching about hyperinflation leading to market failure before he decided to leave Twitter. NOW for the past 2 years the general media/investing community has been very harsh towards Warren Buffetts investment style, while he sits on 140 billion of cash. Now, Couple that with Goldman‚Äôs Exodus from their inflated tech stocks.Both these firms remained relatively stagnant after the crash last March. While other banks also sit on more capital than anytime before. Why? Why do these firms have so much cash?Especially when the market helps protect that cash from inflation based devaluation.The answer is right in front of us and it‚Äôs that the system is in trouble.

"Hi all dear brothers, sisters and dear friends. I'm a lurker since January 2021. I have never purchased stock or shares in my entire life. I finally worked hard, made the decision and was able to afford a humble double digit amount which I have been holding through the entire ride of green and red. Humanity has suffered far too much, and is suffering right now. The world's rich can end hunger in about 1 hour if they all spared 1% of their wealth collectively and at least fed  clothed and sheltered the poor. But wealth is a trial for Mankind, and money does indeed corrupt the soul. All Saints of all Faiths chose poverty over wealth, to become closer to God and live a pure, simple and spiritual life of peace.I work 7 days a week. Around 65+ hours. I provide for my kids, my Wife, my Parents and help some people I know. I am the sole earner. I have never desired wealth or riches, my wealth is my Belief, my Prayers and my contentment of the soul.THE PLAN.I will HODL until any reasonable figure between 1 Million and 10 Million, or otherwise I will never sell. But can I afford to lose my money? OH YES. This is bigger than money, this is about principle, about the unfair wretched gap between the truly poor and destitute and the overly ungrateful rich. If it does not squeeze anywhere near those figures, I will happily HODL for years, or the rest of my life. If I sell for between those numbers stated, here is my actual plan:I will adopt Orphans, not 1, but many, and give them the best love, care and life they could ever have dreamt of. I will raise them as my own blood children until they are married and become self sustaining Adults.I will give huge amounts to trustworthy Charities, for the broken, poor and needy, affected by disaster and war, help pay for Water Wells, Eyesight operations, donate money to help the poor make an earning and livelihood out of some form of work or trade. I will go on holidays to very poor areas and give mysterious packages of money to poor people living in tents, shacks, poor dwellings and ask for their Prayers as they cry in gratefulness. What does God love about the poor? They have nothing, yet they are the most generous. If you have not eaten, they will break their bread and give you the larger piece. If you go to their tent, they will put something in front of you on the table. This is Humanity, this is that true Faith means and teaches.This is the only Community I have ever come across, where colour, race, religion, background, and any single difference whatsoever has no relevance, except our common goodwill. Each post I see of generous Apes donating to Children's Hospitals brings tears to my eyes. Our dear sister who worked so hard and bought 1 share with 3 months Salary for the cause brought tears to my eyes.This is not a temporary phenomenon or awakening. This is a permanent family. We will continue to become ONE group of love, common goodwill, respect, manners, care and generosity well after any squeeze which will eventually squoze. This is why the billionaire rich cannot understand our resolve. This is why all their algorithms could not calculate our Diamond Hands.My love, heart and care goes for you all, I am praying for the benefit of each and every one of you, but promise me one thing - DO NOT BECOME greedy, arrogant and boastful with your newly given wealth. Stay real, stay humble and stay GENEROUS. Help those in need and make a change in this World, because your life is only temporary, and the opportunity to do good is also a small window that is temporary. I will look for my Ape brothers and sisters in the Craters of the Moon, God bless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yesterday I went to the movie theater by me. We don't have an AMC here. When I walked in I noted that the arcade room in the left side was empty. My initial thought was. What a waste of space and money. I think it would make a ton of sense to replace the arcades in some movie theaters with GME stores or just add some GME stores to AMC theaters. Why would I do that?Many people who goes to the movies are also the ones who buy GME merchandise.If you go to visit a GME store and find out about the movies you may end up watching more movies. Many stores have plenty of parking. Make easy for parents to take kids to either AMC theater or GME store.We all grow up going to the movies with our parents, friends and family. We build good memories doing that. With a GME store right there it is like all that candy in the check out lane in a supermarket. Got the spirit. What a better way to build brand loyalty than building great memories !!!If both companies do well. We the stock holders will do well. I will keep trading stocks with both AMC and GME with years to come. After the squeeze happens I will likely sell covered calls and cash covered put on both and add to my positions on both with that. Why? Because I too like the stock !!!But until that happens and if it happens I will continue to buying and hold on both until both squeezes come!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"With short interest at 44% on one page and days to cover at less than one, I do not believe a SHORT squeeze is in the cards, it can be covered with half of daily volume. They can short it to 100% and cover in a day, sad but true.I DO however, believe the gamma squeeze remains a possibility with options expiring in the money, I think the juice for that will come with quarterly rebalancing for indexes (Wednesday is the end of Q1) and index reconstitution that happens twice a year for GICS indexes, like the S&amp;P 500 (May &amp; November).AMC &amp; GME have moved up enough to be picked up by additional growth indexes and market cap weighted indexes (GME enough to sneak into the S&amp;P 500), to illustrate the point here's what GME needs to do to get into the S&amp;P 500, which would be tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds, in buying the indexes are required to do based on their own rules, and that would feed into the gamma play.S&amp;P Inclusion rules:1. Market Cap over 11.3B (Check)2. Annual dollar value traded to a float-adjusted Market Cap is greater than 1.0 (Check)3. Minimum monthly volume of 250k shares (Check, check, check thanks to you fucking apes).4. Publicly listed on either the NYSE (CHECK) or NASDAQ.5. Company from the US (CHECK)6. Not one of the prohibited security classes (LPs, MLPs, ITs, OTC/pink sheets, closed end funds, ETFs, etc.) (CHECK)The big issue for these two would be a committee review, that's required and could be fucked, the fact that margin is being clamped down on tells me somebody heard something from their former roommate about this not going to be the stopping factor to inclusion, so they've got to get their house in order and they have a week/2 months for various scenarios.Since indexes are reconstituted quarterly (Wed) then there would be buying there, in theory. They have rules on inclusion like buffering (holding out until it meets criteria for a certain, predetermined length of time) and packeting (including say 20% of the current float in the index, then as it maintains it adding more, again on predetermined lengths of time).I could see Wednesday being a good day, followed by a good Friday with a lot of options moving from OTM to ITM at expiration, then in May, those help propel to a possible S&amp;P 500 inclusion and more institutional buying.Again, just my thoughts on why the SHORT squeeze is a pipe dream now and the GAMMA squeeze is possible still, and the big moves will come from indexes.Basically as long as GME doesn't crash at this point, it's going up. Likely similar for AMC, options compound to the long or short side accordingly with dealer hedging to remain delta neutral (so remember when you buy puts, you fucking idiots, dealers are required to short shares in proportion to the delta of the derivative instrument at the time and rebalance daily).Remember, do your own due diligence and I'm retarded, I eat crayons to fuel my smooth brain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
